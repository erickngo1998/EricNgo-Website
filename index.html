        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Undergraduate StudentðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently an Undergraduate Student pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry with a Medical Emphasis. I have worked in multiple research labs with one trying to discover a new methodology in discovering drought and the other, understanding the virology of HIV in regards with its envelope. I have also created the Biochemistry Club with the aid of my peers and mentors, to provide sources for students in the major as well as help encourage young minds to pursue a career in STEM. I am working towards a career in medicine as a Physician. <br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">From my experiences working with a wide age range of patients, I have learned to notice their nonverbal cues which allowed me to help them openly express their concern and needs. I also learned how to properly interact with the patients by taking the time to tailor my care to their cultural customs. A goal of mine is to provide a comfortable environment for patients, and I believe that being a part of RFC would give me the chance to do that. From these experiences, it has made me realize that I not only want to tend to the patientsâ€™ medical needs but to also eliminate the social disconnect between health care providers and patients. By being in RFC, it would allow me to enhance my acquired knowledge and skill set so that I can be better equipped to empower people to become more proactive about taking care of their health as well as provide excellent care to patients and ultimately, the Riverside community, one patient at a time.
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I have been given the opportunity to start helping the underserved communities by taking care of the elderly in a patient home, to improve their quality of life by feeding them, helping them exercise, and simply by lending an ear. To me, this was a stepping stone towards expanding my experience in serving such communities. It is evident that quality health care is not equally assessible to everyone. And I believe that a personâ€™s right to receiving health care should not be limited by their financial status. Thus, I am determined to provide a helping hand to those who are not as fortunate in receiving aid as well as to slowly break down the social constructs that prevents them from doing so. Providing aid does not simply have be done through medicine but also acknowledging the daily social dilemmas that comes with their health issues. My interest is not to simply help treat their diseases but to also uphold a better sense of community.
